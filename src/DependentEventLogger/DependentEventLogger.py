class DependentEventLogger(object):
    ''' DependencyLogger keeps track of past events of some user Agents.

    This module is an alias to DependencyManager. Its functionality is to
    provide an in memory look up table for events executed by some user agents
    in the past few ticks. Current implementation of DependencyLogger is a
    ring buffer style two dimensional array.

    Note:
        step() interface should be invoked in each simulation tick before any
        other agents are simulated.

    Attributes:
        logDepth(int): the depth of look up table. DependencyLogger will only
        remember events up to past logDepth ticks.
        currTime(int): current time of the simulation. This value should be
        consistent with the one in CoreSimulator.
        head(int): head pointer for ring buffer. Its position dictates the next
        slot in log that should store the event.
        log(dict): the place where logs are stored. It is a map from userID to
        a list of set, where each set stores all the events that are performed
        by a particular agent at that timestamp
