    This class is responsible for building agent objects using AnalysisLib. For now, each user in the database is modeled by one separate agent instance. FUTURE IMPROVEMENT: users with homogenous behaviors are grouped into a single generic agent instance. For example, one generic agent class to handle all users who perform only 1 to 3 actions per months.
